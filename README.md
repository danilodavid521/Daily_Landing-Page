# Day Landing Page
It is a simple Landing page made with REACT to practice the basics like 
 - Create Reusable Components
 - hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer)
 - styles by Styled-Components
## About this project
I built the "WELCOME TO DAY" landing page using React.js, focusing on modern features like dark/light mode for flexible theme switching. With GSAP, I implemented smooth scroll animations using ScrollTrigger to activate effects based on scroll position and ScrollSmooth for effortless navigation. I ensured smooth easing for a polished look, along with responsive design and optimized performance. The result is a sleek, interactive page with seamless transitions and engaging animations.
## App Features
